# Hypixel BOT
Welcome to my repository! Well this was a side project I was doing, and I saw lots of **Hypixel Bots** on the [Code Creation forum](https://hypixel.net/forums/code-creations.65/)
and none of them was open-source so I decided to make my own one.

## Requirements
#### Node requirements (already on package.json)
* [discord.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js)
* [Hypixel-API-NodeJS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hypixel-api-nodejs) (I'll create my own wrapper)
* [humanize-duration](https://www.npmjs.com/package/humanize-duration)
#### Other requirements
* Hypixel API Key (run `/api new` on mc.hypixel.net)
* [Discord BOT Token](https://discord.com/developers/applications/me)
* Prior basic *JavaScript* knowledge

## Installation
1. [Clone this repository](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
2. Go to your machine, download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ([Linux](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm), [Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows))
3. Install the requirements, you can do it by just running `npm install` on your terminal
4. **IMPORTANT!** Set your Hypixel's API Key (line 18) and Discord BOT Token (line 19)
5. Run `npm run start` or `node index.js` on your terminal! (I personally prefer using [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/))

## More information about the project!
I know the code in this project at the moment is *so* messy, i'll be pushing updates to make the code understandable and more organized!
Thanks for understanding.
